# LoA
**v 0.0.1**
Micro-site for goal tracking and daily affirmations

## Introduction
'Law of Attraction', 'The Secret', 'Think and Grow Rich', whatever you may subscribe to ... there's a lot of study out there on tips and tricks you can do to help optimize your life.
In these studies, some common themes start to pop up.
The purpose behind 'LoA' is to create a web tool that will allow for anyone to pick and choose from a variety of modules. Then, use these to hopefully to the benefit in their own lives.

## Modules
### Focus
**This module can only work with the "Timeline" module!**
Focus pulls one event from the Timeline list and sets it as the largest element on the homepage/index.
### Timeline
Timeline is a tool that will allow for the user to list out events/accomplishments that they wish to achieve -- coupled with a rough date for completion/reward. If the date passes, the event is moved down to a secondary list of past Events.
### Thanks
A prompt for the user to list several things that they are thankful for.
Current max is 5 items per entry; but on submission, the form reloads with 5 new fields that can be filled.
### Gratitude
**This module can only work with the "Thanks" module!**
Grattude pulls from the past values passed by the Thanks module -- the intent is to remind the user what they were greatful for in the past.
### Inspiration
This is for a personal collection of quotes/ideas that the user may find interesting.
